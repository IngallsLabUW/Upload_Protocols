HILIC (1)
Instrument Name: Thermo Q Exactive HF hybrid Orbitrap
Instrument Type: Orbitrap
MS Type: ESI
Ion Mode: Positive
MS acquisition Comments: Polarity switching was used with a scan range of 80 to 900 m/z and a resolution of 60,000. 
A DDA method was used with a scan range of 80 to 900 m/z.
Data processing Comments: Data was processed as in Boysen and Heal et al. 2018. Analytical Chemistry. 
Software/procedures used for feature assignments: Peaks were integrated using Skyline. Data was processed using quality control and best-matched internal standard normalization.
MS parameters were as follows: capillary temperature was 320 °C, the H-ESI spray voltage was 3.5 kV, and the auxiliary gas heater temperature was 90 °C. The
S-lens RF level was 65. Sheath gas, auxiliary gas, and sweep gas flow rates were maintained
at 16, 3, and 1, respectively.
